**Statistical Mechanics of Coevolutionary Games**  
*MSc Thesis Simulations — Giacomo Frigerio, University of Pavia (2025)*

## Overview

This repository collects the Python simulations, visualizations, and numerical analyses developed for the MSc thesis  
**“Statistical Mechanics of Coevolutionary Games”**,  
supervised by **Prof. Giacomo Livan (University of Pavia)** and **Dr. Federico Maria Quetti (University of Pavia)**.

The project bridges **Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)** and **Statistical Physics**, framing social dilemmas as nonequilibrium systems whose macroscopic regularities emerge from microscopic interaction rules.  
It introduces **feedback-driven coevolutionary models**, where the payoff matrix evolves endogenously with the population state—revealing new cooperative regimes and *Chimera Games* that defy static stability expectations.
